	<h2>IoT</h2>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCpSzYjJTxQ">Geo-Sensing: The Internet of Things in the Supply Chain</a><br>
	<a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/sites/default/files/capstone/posters/InternetofThings_Poster_0.pdf">Poster</a><br>
	The Internet of Things (IoT) revolution is changing everyday practices for logistics companies. Equipping cargos with sensors enhances in-transit visibility and allows 24/7 monitoring of customer shipments from origin to destination. To this end, our research team developed a proof-of-concept based solution to integrate an IoT methodology into a client's supply chain operations. The team configured sensor devices, enabled its communications, accessed an IoT data stream, and transferred real-time status and geo-coordinates from sensors into AWS cloud database. This end-to-end solution aims to connect people, processes, and data via cellular devices. Increasing the supply chain visibility through an IoT method is a real game changer for the transportation industry.<br>Code: Sensor API, REST API, Python, AWS Lambda, AWS MySQL, GoogleMaps<br><br>

	<h2>Descriptive Analytics</h2>
	<a href="http://rpubs.com/anyacha/datasci_NOAA_severe_weather">Severe Weather Effects on Human Life</a><br>
	Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. This report explores the NOAA Storm Database and analyzes how severe weather affects human life across the United States. Part 1 looks at most harmful with respect to population health. Part 2 focuses on events that have the greatest economic consequences.
