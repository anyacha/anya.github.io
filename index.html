	Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. This report explores the NOAA Storm Database and analyzes how severe weather affects human life across the United States. Part 1 looks at most harmful with respect to population health. Part 2 focuses on events that have the greatest economic consequences.
